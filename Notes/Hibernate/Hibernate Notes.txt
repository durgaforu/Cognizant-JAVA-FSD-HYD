Hibernate Notes
--------------------
JDBC -> Java database connectivity

			-> database dependent
			-> Poor transaction management.
			-> Poor Exception handling
			-> Programer SQL stress
			-> Code tangling and scatering 
			-> Connection pooling management is poor

 ORM (Object relational Mapping)
 ----------------------------------
	-> database independent 
	-> No need of any DB SQL knowledge. 
    -> Exception Handling mechanism is good
	-> Transaction management is maintained good
	-> It supports objet oriented programing technique

ORM
------
	-> Hibernate (Soft tree). -> Gavin King
	-> JPA (Java Persistence API ) -> Sun
	-> Toplink (Oracle)
	-> Ibatics (Apache)
	-> EJB (Enterprise Java beans) -> Sun


Hibernate 
============

Hibernate is a light weight open source software who can handle objet
level programing mapping with all relatinal databases

Steps to configure Hibernate
-------------------------------
	1. downoad all dependies of Hibernate
	2. configure hibernate.cfg.xml file for database information
	3. provide entity classes
	4. map entity classes in hibernate.cfg.xml file
	5. write any client application who can read hibernate.cg.xml file
	   -> create a session factory for a single database
	   -> get sessions from session to handle all db operations


Hibernate CRUD operations
----------------------------
	Two Types
		-> Single row operations
		-> Multi row operations

single row operations
-----------------------
	1. save
	2. saveOrUpdate
	3. update
	4. delete
	5. evict
	6. merge

Multi row operations
---------------------
	1. HQL (Hibernate Query Language)
	2. Criteria API
	3. Native SQL


Fetching methods for single row operations
-----------------------------------------------
	1. get -> eager Fetching technique
	2. load -> lazy fetching technique


get
-----
	-> eager fetching technique
	-> NullPointerException raises when finding object not available in db
	-> hits the database even when you are not using returned object from database

load
-----
	-> lazy fetching technique
	-> ObjectNotfoundException raises when finding object not available in db
	-> does not hit database even when target object is not available in db

Note: Hibernate software single row operations will works only on primary key
      columns. If a database tabble does not have a primary key, then 
	  hibernte software doesn't support that table.
