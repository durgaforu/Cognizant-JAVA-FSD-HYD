Encapulation
--------------------
-> Binding of methods and properties together in a class
	-> Access modifiers
	-> Packages



Access Modifiers do?
----------------------
	-> access level to properties and methods in a class
	-> security constraints can be removed
	-> they set access visibility levels throw out application


Package
----------
	-> A package gropups classes in a logical structured mannger
	-> A package is a separation of classes as per the class levels given by the programer
	-> Simply a package means a folder


Access Modifiers
------------------
	-> public
	-> protected
	-> default
	-> private


POJO class   (Plain old java object) -> API Independent
-----------------------------------------------------------

-> POJO/BEAN/MODEL/ENTITY

Rules for Pojo class construction
-----------------------------------
	-> Every property in the class should be defined as private
	-> Every methods in the class should be defined as public with getters and setters

Getters
---------
	-> getters will have return type, but no parameters
Settes
---------
	-> setters will have parametrs but no retrurn types.
