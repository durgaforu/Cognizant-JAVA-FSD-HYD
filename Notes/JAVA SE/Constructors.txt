Constructors
----------------
-> Its a special method which executes autometivcally when the object of the class is craeted

Rules
------
	-> class name and constructor name should be same
	-> constructors should not have any return types, not even void
	-> they can have parameters

Notes
-------
-> By defalt, JVM adds a default constructor, if you are not providing any parametarized constructors


-> Sub class always contains copy of a super class constructors.
-> when we provide default constructor in super and sub classes, then sub class object can invoke
   both class default constructors.
-> When we provide parametarized constructor in super class, and not provided default constructor in the    super class, then JVM will not add a default constructor to the super class autometically.
-> In this case, creating object the sub class with defalt constructor is impossible
-> We have two solutions to this issue.
	-> provide default constructor in the super class
	-> explicilty invoke super class parametarized constructor from the sub class default 
           constructor using super keyword
-> When we provide only default constructor to the sub class, and trying to invoke parametarized 
   constructor of a sub class, then providing parametarized constructor in the sub class is 
   mandatary. this invokes super class default constructor and sub class parametarized constructor.


-> When super class and sub class both are having parametarized constructor, and sub class is having
   default constructor, if you are invoking parametarized constructor of a sub class, then providing
   default constructor in the super class is mandatary. other wise you should explicitly invoke
   super class parametarized constructor from the default constructor of a sub class by uisng 
   super key word.
