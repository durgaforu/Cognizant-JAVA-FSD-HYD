Notes
--------
1. A super class reference/object can store all its sub class/implementation class objects.
2. A reference of a super class can be used to access all the methods in the super class, and
   over ridden methods of a sub class. 
3. A reference of a super class can not be used to access the individual methods (a method which is    there in the sub class and not present in the super class) of a sub class.


Final classes
-----------------
Final classes can not be used to be super class to any other classes in java
