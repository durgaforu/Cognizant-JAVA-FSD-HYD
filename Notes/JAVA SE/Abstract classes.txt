Abstract classes
---------------------
-> An abstract class is a method specification which contains 0 or more abstract methods, concreate 
   methods and constructors
-> abstract method do not specify body. Its only methods specification
-> we cannot create an object to the abstract class, but we can create a reference variable to the 
   abstract class
-> The reference of an abstract class can store or holds all its sub class/implementation class  objects
-> The rerence of an abstract class can be used to access all the methods in the abstract class, and
   common methods (methods which are present in abstract class and sub class) of a sub class
-> The reference of an abstract class cannot be used to access the individual methods (a metod which is    avialble only in the sub class not in the super class) of a sub class
-> If any sub class is extending an abstract class, then that sub class must override all the 
   abstract methods of abstract class
-> Any any sub class is not overrriding any one of the abstract methods of an abstract class, then 
   that sub class should be defined as 'abstract'
-> A class can not defined both at - a time as 'abstract' and 'final'
