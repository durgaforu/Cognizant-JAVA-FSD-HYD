Class Notes
--------------------
 class: Its a High level group name.
Ex: Fruit, Employee, Vehicle

What class contains?
	-> properties/ variables / fields
	Types of properties?
		-> instance properties
		-> static properties / non static
		-> final properties
		-> trainsient
		-> volatile
		-> const properties

	----------------------------------------------
	-> methods
		-> instance methods
		-> static methods
		-> final methods
		-> abstract methods
		-> native methods
	----------------------------------------------

	-> constructors
		-> empty constructors
		-> parametarized constructors

Class Types:
	-> concreate class
	-> abstract class
	-> final class

Notes
-----
	-> Static methods never allow non static data to access directly
	-> We need object to access non static data in a static method
	-> We need object to access non static data in the non static method, if non static data is in other classes
	-> non static methods accepts static data and non static data directly with out help of any objects
	   if that data is avaiable in the same class where non static method is defined
	   
	   

Static
-------
-> content of a static data is common for all the object accross the application
-> Static data can be assigned any where in the class. Assigning static data with object is not recamemded.
-> static methods accepts only static data
-> non static methods accepts static and non static data directly
-> static methods accepts non static data only with help of objects
-> static data can be accessble with out object or class name if that data is defined in the same class
-> If that static data is defined in other class, then we should access that static data with class name where
   that static data is defined.
